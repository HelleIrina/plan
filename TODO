* Cache ical as it _will_ get hit often

* course_list currently isn't cached...

* RRULEs for ical?

* Cleanup urls for my debug stuff.

* Semester based import urls (has been started)

* Handle refreshing of course data:
  - Do this in a db transaction
  - Add all lectures keeping track of the ones we add
  - Delete all lectures for given course during this semester that have not
    been readded.

* AJAX helper for adding courses?

* Allow setting of course urls? addtional urls?

* Better user feedbacks when stuff can't be added (add
  'message:<slug>:<remote_addr>' in cache. not sure about remote_addr)

  Needs to work around curent cacheing, or cacheing needs to be moved to template level.

* Use request.path as cache key?

---

* Support variable start stop times:
  - Store actual times in db
  - Map times to intervals that we want to show.

* Add meta sets that are not linked to semesters years, MDTD-1 MTDT-2 etc
