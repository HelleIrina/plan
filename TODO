Wishlist:

Long term:
----------
* Add meta sets that are not linked to semesters years, MDTD-1 MTDT-2 etc

Won't fix:
----------
* User wants "Coursne name (course code)" for ical summary (superseeded by alias)
* AJAX helper for adding courses?
* Allow setting of course urls? addtional urls?
* Better user feedbacks when stuff can't be added (add
  'message:<slug>:<remote_addr>' in cache. not sure about remote_addr)
  Needs to work around curent cacheing, or cacheing needs to be moved to template level.
* Cleanup urls for my debug stuff.
* redirect to course list for first timers adding a text input for manual input
