Cpurrent:
--------
* RRULEs for ical?

* Allow custom lectures?

* Link to official data source per course for comparison.

* redirect to course list for first timers adding a text input for manual input

* translate

* Use "smarter" primary keys, ie course code for courses etc.

* Add exam type to data model using "smart" primary key

* Print view

* VTODO

Wishlist:
---------

* User wants "Coursne name (course code)" for ical summary

* Link to official data source per course for comparison.

* redirect to course list for first timers adding a text input for manual input

* translate

* Room links to map

* Show current week view

Long term:
----------
* Support variable start stop times:
  - Store actual times in db
  - Map times to intervals that we want to show.

* Add meta sets that are not linked to semesters years, MDTD-1 MTDT-2 etc

Won't fix:
----------
* AJAX helper for adding courses?

* Allow setting of course urls? addtional urls?

* Better user feedbacks when stuff can't be added (add
  'message:<slug>:<remote_addr>' in cache. not sure about remote_addr)

  Needs to work around curent cacheing, or cacheing needs to be moved to template level.

* Cleanup urls for my debug stuff.
