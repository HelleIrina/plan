* ideas
  - south or dmigrations?
  - hosting
    * use pip + virtualenv? for nice enviroment
  - course
    * Link to official data source per course for comparison.
  - convert to more general ical/event/todo model?
  - Css hover magic for rooms lists with more than one room
  - croudsource new lecture and deadline data
  - Look at lupy, http://www.rkblog.rk.edu.pl/w/p/django-lupy/
  - add feedback field


Ideas from IME:
---------------
* mobile version
* iphone/ipdod-touch version
* fix Gcal import issues
* data retrival from ntnu webservice
* pre defined plans for student groups
* sso -> timetable with preset course data
* deadline retrival
* reuse other peoples entries
* exams and facebook events

Other major feature ideas:
--------------------------
* Course anouncements via RSS
* Course official deadlines via iCal

Wishlist:
---------
* RRULEs for ical?
* Room links to map

Long term:
----------
* Add meta sets that are not linked to semesters years, MDTD-1 MTDT-2 etc

Won't fix:
----------
* User wants "Coursne name (course code)" for ical summary (superseeded by alias)
* AJAX helper for adding courses?
* Allow setting of course urls? addtional urls?
* Better user feedbacks when stuff can't be added (add
  'message:<slug>:<remote_addr>' in cache. not sure about remote_addr)
  Needs to work around curent cacheing, or cacheing needs to be moved to template level.
* Cleanup urls for my debug stuff.
* redirect to course list for first timers adding a text input for manual input
