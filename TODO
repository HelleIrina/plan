Current:
--------
* RRULEs for ical?

* Handle refreshing of course data:
  - Delete all lectures for given course during this semester that have not
    been readded.

* dato.XML import

Long term:
----------
* Support variable start stop times:
  - Store actual times in db
  - Map times to intervals that we want to show.

* Add meta sets that are not linked to semesters years, MDTD-1 MTDT-2 etc

Won't fix:
----------
* AJAX helper for adding courses?

* Allow setting of course urls? addtional urls?

* Better user feedbacks when stuff can't be added (add
  'message:<slug>:<remote_addr>' in cache. not sure about remote_addr)

  Needs to work around curent cacheing, or cacheing needs to be moved to template level.

* Use request.path as cache key?

* Cleanup urls for my debug stuff.
