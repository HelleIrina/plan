This piece of software started out as a simple tool to assist
in creating readable timetables from lecture times at NTNU.
The earliest version of the site provided this functionality
and nothing more. As more fellow students started using the
software new features where added based on personal needs
and suggestions from other students.

Today the software provides the following:

* Simple interface for adding courses.
* Customizable view of your timetable.
* Easy export to Google-Calendar via iCal.
* PDF-version for printing.
* User defined deadlines.
* Import of course data from ntnu.no or database-dumps.
